This is the place to connect with other developers, restaurant owners, and contributors building the future of open-source menu management.

- **Show & Tell**: Built a cool menu or customized the UI? Show us screenshots! 📸
- **Q&A**: Stuck on deployment or Supabase setup? Ask away. 💡
- **Feature Ideas**: "Wouldn't it be cool if..." - yes, tell us! 🧠
- **General Chat**: Just want to say hi? We love that too. 👋

### 🦄 For Contributors
